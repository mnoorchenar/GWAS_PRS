# GWAS Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Application üß¨

Welcome to the **GWAS PRS Application** ‚Äî an interactive platform to simulate genetic and demographic data, build predictive models, and explore disease risk factors.

This app is designed for **students**, **researchers**, and **enthusiasts** who want to understand how genetic variations and lifestyle factors contribute to disease risk ‚Äî **without needing any coding skills**.

## Features üöÄ

- **Generate Synthetic Data**
  - Create customized datasets with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and demographic features like age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.
  - Adjust the number of samples, disease prevalence, and data complexity (noise level).

- **Customize Effect Sizes**
  - Fine-tune the influence of each SNP and demographic factor on disease outcomes.
  - Simulate simple linear or complex non-linear relationships.

- **Train Machine Learning Models**
  - Choose from Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Decision Tree models.
  - Easily tweak model parameters (tree depth, number of trees, etc.) and view training results.

- **Analyze Individual Patients**
  - Select a patient and review their demographics, genetic markers, and predicted risk.
  - Visualize **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)** and **feature importance** using SHAP plots.
